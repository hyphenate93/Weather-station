# Weather Station Project
Description
This project is a weather station designed to monitor environmental parameters such as temperature, air pressure, and the location of the sun. It includes a user interface for viewing logged data and adjusting settings. The system uses the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM embedded computer platform as its main board.

The key components of the system are:
 Atmel SAM3X8E –ARM embedded computer platform, main board
o LEDs
 Breadboard connected with cable to main board
o Keypad (port I/O)
o Photo sensor (A/D)
o Temperature sensor (time)
o RC servo motor (PWM)
o Air pressure sensor (i2c)
o Switch (HW-int)
o Display (port I/O)


Usage
Follow instructions on the display (provided you connected the hardware correctly compared to the software)
